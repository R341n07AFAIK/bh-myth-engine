    35mm surreal-propaganda-noir inside the BH project world:
    rain-slick bureaucratic shrines, neon shrine-lamps glitching through fog,
    chrome-ink BH operative in trenchcoat, half-face erased by static light columns,
    corrupted cathedral monitors flickering with surveillance saints,
    Soviet-brutalist geometry fused with absurdist future artifacts,
    sympathizer crowds dissolving into editorial silhouettes,
    volumetric smoke, wet asphalt reflections, muted reds and ashen blacks,
    Dali-like melt in architectural edges, retro-cyber Vatican circuitry,
    everything morally gray, exhausted, stylishly dangerous.
